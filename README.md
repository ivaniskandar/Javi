# Javi

It has two features:
1. Caffeine, keeps your device's screen on. Useful when you want to watch a long a$$ GIF on a meme app without needing to keep your finger pressed on the screen.
2. Hypnotic, turns off your device's screen when the proximity sensor is activated. One of the _possible_ use case is when you want to listen to your music playlist on a certain app but they force you to pay to listen with screen off.

That's it. There's a QS Tile shortcut for both features for quick access from another app.
